## 🛡️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | `sk-proj-...` | ✅ Yes |
| `PORT` | Server port | `5000` | No |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `production` | No |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed to generate plan" Error**
- **Check OpenAI API Key**: Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/test-openai`
- **Verify Billing**: Ensure your OpenAI account has billing enabled
- **Check Quota**: You might have exceeded your API usage limits
- **Server Logs**: Check backend console for detailed error messages

**2. CORS Errors**
- **Backend Running**: Make sure server is running on port 5000
- **Deployment URLs**: Verify frontend can reach backend URL
- **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and try again

**3. 504 Timeout Errors**
- **Large Requests**: Try shorter duration (1-2 weeks) to test
- **Server Overload**: Wait a moment and try again
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: API might be temporarily rate-limited

**4. Data Not Saving**
- **LocalStorage Full**: Clear browser data or use "Clear all data" button
- **Browser Settings**: Ensure localStorage is enabled in browser
- **Private Mode**: Some browsers limit localStorage in private/incognito mode

**5. Vercel Deployment Issues**
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure OpenAI key is set in Vercel dashboard
- **Build Errors**: Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
- **CORS Configuration**: Verify backend allows frontend domain

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# OpenAI connection test
curl http://localhost:5000/api/test-openai

# Test learning path generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/generate-path \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"goal":"Python","level":"Beginner","duration":1,"perDay":1}'

# View detailed server logs
cd server && npm run dev

# Check frontend build
cd client && npm run build
```

### Browser Debugging

```javascript
// Check localStorage data
Object.keys(localStorage).filter(key => key.startsWith('learnbloom-'))

// Clear all app data
Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(key => key.startsWith('learnbloom-'))
  .forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key))

// Check API connectivity
fetch('http://localhost:5000/health')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
```
